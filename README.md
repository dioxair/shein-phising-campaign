# shein-phising-campaign

A phising campaign mimicking SHEIN for a class project

## Phase 1
The target get sent a fake "Special Deal for You" SHEIN branded email, pretending to show big 30% sales from SHEIN. Pressing the "Collect All" button on the email will redirect the user to a fake SHEIN login page, beginning Phase 2

## Phase 2
The target gets sent to a fake clone of the SHEIN login page. If the target enters a username and password into the login page and clicks the continue button, the username and password will be logged in a server.

After the target clicks "CONTINUE", they will be sent to another page asking for credit/debit card information, like card number, expiration date, security code. If the target enters the information and clicks the continue button, the card information will be logged in a server.

TODO: Ask for billing address information as well.
